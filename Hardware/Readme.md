## Getting started with Hardware
### Assembly Instructions
Before you start, Get the proper set of equipment.

* The Third Hand is always helpful in assembly. I recommend using some soldering Jig or Stickvise Jaws 
* Its super handy to have a cutting knife
* Better have some Non Serrated Pliers
* Obviously, A soldering Iron
* Solder Paste would be useful
* Great to have some extra Soldering Iron tips to get the perfect size

The Soldering Kit below May give you a good idea of what you need.

## General tips

 * Keep both the schematics and the board file open while you build, you'll likely want to refer back to them more often than not.
 Even I got you covered here. This [Interactive BOM](https://github.com/maitesam/OpenADSP/blob/main/Documents/ibom.html) will help you out locating the components and their references.
 Just Download the file and Open it in your Browser.
 It should present you with something like this

 * **The passives are indistinguishable once taken out of their tapes!**
   * Always work with a single value at a time
   * Only remove as many components from the tape as you need right now
   * Immediately put the tape back into the pouch it came in, as that's where the value is noted - or write the value onto the tape.

 * For each group of passives below, it saves time to batch up different types of operations: First put a small solder blob on one pad of each site, then tack down each component, then solder the other side for all components in a row.

 * If the solder joints on nearby passives blob together a lot, use some flux and a little less solder. It's also a good idea to make a final flux pass across the finished passives just like you would be drag soldering a leaded part, it makes the solder joints look a lot nicer.

### Assembly instructions

These instructions are optimized for hand assembly; the components are grouped in a way that if you follow the groups in order you should never have one component in the way of soldering another. Within a given group the order does not matter; I recommend doing all components of one value before moving on to the next value.


I found this Tutorial Video by @Electronoobs really helpful.
