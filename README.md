## Description
This device is designed to Take data from Microphone and Process it. Later it could be sent to a wirelessly connected devices Over Bluetooth.
Aside from this, the device can stream data to host computer over USB interface.

The PCB embedds a STM32L432 MCU which is extremely capable of handling Demanding tasks such as Digital Signal Processing.
The DSP scripts could be implemented in the firmware.
